summary: "Kappa architecture is a data-processing architecture that is designed to process data in real time. It is a single-layer architecture that uses a streaming processing engine to process data as it is received. This architecture is simpler and more efficient than the Lambda architecture, and it can be implemented at a lower cost."

In our [previous blog post]({{< ref "/blog/lambda-architecture">}}), we learned about Lambda architecture, a data processing architecture that combines batch processing with real-time/stream processing. We also identified the pros and cons of this architecture.

One of the biggest drawbacks of Lambda architecture is that it can be complex and expensive to implement. This is because it requires the implementation and maintenance of two separate processing pipelines, one for batch processing and another for real-time/stream processing. This additional complexity and cost can be a major barrier for organizations that are looking to adopt this architecture. In addition, Lambda architecture can also be difficult to scale as the volume of data increases. This is because the batch processing layer is typically more difficult to scale than the real-time/stream processing layer. As a result, organizations that are dealing with large volumes of data may find that the Lambda architecture is not a scalable solution for their needs.

Overall, the Lambda architecture is a complex and expensive solution that may not be suitable for all organizations. Organizations that are looking for a simpler and more cost-effective solution may want to consider other data processing architectures, such as the Kappa architecture. Kappa architecture has gained popularity in recent years because it is simpler, more scalable, and easier to maintain than Lambda architecture.

Jay Kreps, one of the co-founders of Apache Kafka, first proposed the Kappa architecture in a [blog post](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/questioning-the-lambda-architecture/) in 2014. In his blog post, Kreps argued that the traditional Lambda architecture was too complex and difficult to maintain, and proposed the Kappa architecture as a simpler, more scalable alternative for real-time data processing.

Kappa architecture is designed to handle big data processing in real-time. The core idea behind Kappa architecture is to eliminate the need for a separate batch layer implemented in Lambda architecture. In Kappa architecture, all processing is done on a single stream of data, and the results are stored in a database that can be queried in real-time.

The primary components of Kappa architecture are:

* ___Data sources___: The data source is the point where the data is collected.. These are the inputs to the system, which can be any data source that generates real-time data, such as IoT sensors, social media streams, or logs.

* ___Streaming processing engine___: This streaming processing engine is responsible for processing the incoming data in real-time. The stream processing layer can use a variety of tools and technologies, such as Apache Flink, Apache Kafka Streams, or Apache Storm.

* ___Data Store___: The data store is where the results of the stream processing layer are stored. This can be a database, a data warehouse, or a cloud storage service. Typical data stores could be a NoSQL database such as VMware Greenplum or Apache Cassandra, which is designed to handle large volumes of data and provide high availability.

* ___Applications___: The applications are the systems that use the processed data. These applications can be analytics tools, dashboards, or machine learning models.

The Kappa architecture works by first collecting data from the data source. The data is then processed by the streaming processing engine in real time. The processed data is then stored in the data store. Finally, the applications use the processed data to generate insights or take action.

The key benefits of Kappa architecture are:

* Simplicity: The Kappa architecture is a simpler architecture than the Lambda architecture. This is because it only has one layer, which makes it easier to understand and implement.

* Efficiency: The Kappa architecture is a more efficient architecture than the Lambda architecture. This is because it only needs to process data once, which saves resources.

* Cost-effectiveness: The Kappa architecture is a more cost-effective architecture than the Lambda architecture. This is because it only needs one processing engine, which saves money.

By eliminating the batch layer, Kappa architecture makes it easier to build and maintain big data processing systems. This means that all data, including historical data, is processed in real-time and stored in the streaming layer. Historical data is simply treated as another stream of data and is processed in the same way as real-time data. When historical data is first ingested into the Kappa architecture, it is processed in real-time and stored in the streaming layer, just like any new incoming data. This allows historical data to be processed and analyzed in real-time, without the need for a separate batch layer. Any historical queries can be answered by querying the same streaming layer that is used to process real-time data.
Additionally, Kappa architecture is designed to be highly scalable, which makes it ideal for processing large volumes of data in real-time. Overall, the Kappa architecture is a simpler, more efficient, and more cost-effective architecture than the Lambda architecture. It is a good choice for organizations that need to process data in real time and do not need the flexibility of the Lambda architecture.

However, Kappa architecture is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and may not be the best choice for all use cases. As with any technology, it is important to carefully evaluate your specific requirements and consider the strengths and limitations of Kappa architecture before deciding whether it is the right approach for your organization.
