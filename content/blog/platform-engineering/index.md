# Platform Engineering: An Overview

Platform engineering is an emerging discipline that transcends traditional IT roles by bridging software development (Dev), operations (Ops), and quality assurance (QA) into a coherent, streamlined workflow. This engineering field focuses on building and maintaining the __'platform'__ , an integrated set of tools and services that optimizes the entire lifecycle of an application, from design, development and deployment to maintenance, scaling and observability. The ultimate goal of platform engineering is to enhance developer productivity and operational efficiency. By removing friction from the development process, engineers can focus on adding business value rather than being bogged down by operational concerns. A robust platform ensures that software can be delivered faster, more securely, and with higher quality, thereby accelerating the pace of innovation. 

# What is a platform

At its heart, the platform in platform engineering refers to a foundation that abstracts underlying infrastructure complexities, offering a unified and consistent experience to developers. It is the process of designing and constructing a shared, standardized infrastructure and workflow processes that developers can use as a foundation for building and running applications. At its core, the platform consists of compute resources, middleware, databases, security policies, CI/CD pipelines, and other underlying services that are orchestrated to work together seamlessly. The platform often includes, but is not limited to:

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** -  To provision and manage infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

**Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: To automate the integration of code changes and streamline the delivery of applications to various environments.

**Microservices and Containerization**: To structure applications as a collection of loosely coupled services, which improves modularity and makes the application easier to understand, develop, and test.

**Monitoring and Observability**: To track application performance and health, ensuring that any issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

**Internal developer portal** - To enable developers to collaborate effectively and improve developer experience.


The ultimate goal of platform engineering is to enhance developer productivity and operational efficiency. By removing friction from the development process, engineers can focus on adding business value rather than being bogged down by operational concerns. A robust platform ensures that software can be delivered faster, more securely, and with higher quality, thereby accelerating the pace of innovation.

# The need for platform engineering

In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, the complexity and scalability challenges of building modern applications necessitate a strategic shift towards platform engineering. As software systems grow in complexity and scale, the traditional approach to managing infrastructure and deployments becomes inadequate. This complexity stems from the shift towards containerization, multi-cloud infrastructures and an increased focus on security. The proliferation of microservices, cloud-native applications, and the need for rapid iteration further compound these challenges. Platform engineering addresses these complexities by providing a standardized, automated, and self-service infrastructure that allows developers to focus on writing code, not managing it. This results in a rapid increase in developer productivity.

By fostering an environment where developer productivity flourishes, platform engineering forms the backbone for digital transformation. It is the foundation upon which businesses are re-imagining their operations, enabling developers to move swiftly, reduce inefficiencies, and focus on creating value. A well-architected platform serves as a catalyst, not just accommodating the cloud's dynamic nature but leveraging it to foster a culture of continuous improvement and experimentation. It enables organizations to adapt to the rapid changes in technology, meet the accelerating demand for new software features, and handle the pressures of increased system complexity. As businesses pivot towards cloud-native solutions and embrace agile methodologies, platform engineering provides the stability and agility needed to compete in a digital-first world.
