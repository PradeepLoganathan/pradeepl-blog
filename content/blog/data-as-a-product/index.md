# Evolution of data as a strategic asset

Traditional data management practices primarily focused on operational data systems, such as transaction processing systems. The emphasis was on maintaining and updating operational databases to support day-to-day business functions. This transactional data was often managed in silos, with different departments or business units maintaining their own databases. This approach was characterized by a lack of integration and communication between different data sources. Each department would have its own systems and processes for managing its data, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies. Reporting and analysis were often secondary considerations, and they were generally retrospective in nature, providing insights after the fact.  Data analysis, when it occurred, was often a manual process. It involved extracting data from various sources, often into spreadsheets, for manual manipulation and analysis. This analysis was primarily focussed on departmental data held within these transaction processing systems. The scope of analytics was limited, and was tactical in nature.

In an increasingly competitive market, leveraging data effectively became a key differentiator. Organizations began to recognize the value of data-driven decision-making. Organizations that could quickly turn data into actionable insights gained a competitive advantage.  This required a more integrated approach to data management, with an emphasis on ensuring data quality and accessibility. As technology advanced, organizations began to adopt Business Intelligence tools. BI represented a shift towards more proactive data analysis, offering better reporting, dashboards, and basic analytics. The integration of data from various sources into data warehouses became more common, allowing for a more unified view of the organization's data. Operational data sources began to be interconnected and integrated into a larger ecosystem. Data governance became more important, focusing on data accuracy, privacy, and compliance.

The realization that data could be a strategic asset led to a cultural shift. Companies started to view data not just as a by-product of business processes but as a core product that could drive innovation and revenue. The success of agile methodologies in software development influenced data management practices. Concepts such as domain driven design (DDD) influenced how teams viewed their data assets. The focus shifted to delivering data products that are user-friendly and continuously improved based on user feedback.
