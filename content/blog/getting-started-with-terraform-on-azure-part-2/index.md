This session on "Terraform 101 - Getting started with Terraform" was recorded as part of the Sunshine coast .Net users group meetup. The first part of this session is [here]({{< ref "blog/getting-started-with-terraform-on-azure-part-1">}})

For those new to Terraform or seeking a more foundational understanding, be sure to visit my [Getting Started with Terraform]({{< ref "/blog/terraform-getting-started">}}) blog post. It provides a thorough introduction to the basics of Terraform, setting a solid groundwork for the concepts and practices demonstrated in these video sessions

If you're interested in seeing how the principles of Terraform align with the broader scope of GitOps, I encourage you to explore my detailed post on [GitOps]({{< ref "/blog/gitops">}}). This post delves into how GitOps methodology can streamline and enhance infrastructure management, complementing what we've covered in these Terraform sessions.
