# Introduction

In the evolving landscape of web services and API design, the choice of architectural style plays a pivotal role in shaping the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of API interactions. Architectural styles such as SOAP and REST have long dominated API design. The technical landscape is evolving rapidly and technologies such as gRPC and GraphQL now provide strong alternatives to these established architectural frameworks. In this blog post we will look at how gRPC helps build a fast and efficient API and also implement an "HelloWorld" gRPC api with dotnet.

gRPC is a modern, open-source, high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment. It enables client and server applications to communicate transparently and simplifies the building of connected systems. Developed by Google, gRPC is part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). gRPC is a high-performance, language-agnostic RPC framework, leveraging HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and providing features like authentication, load balancing, and many others. The primary strength of gRPC lies in its ability to facilitate efficient, low-latency communication between services, making it an ideal choice for microservices architectures and systems where performance is paramount. Since its introduction, gRPC has seen widespread adoption across various industries and applications, particularly benefiting microservices architectures due to its efficiency and cross-platform capabilities.

# The Compelling Case for gRPC: Performance and Flexibility

Choosing an architectural style to build API's is a matter of trade offs and prioritization of features. The primary advantages of using gRPC are:

- High Performance: Utilizes HTTP/2 protocol, enabling multiplexed requests and server push capabilities, significantly reducing latency and bandwidth usage. [See this blog post]({{< ref "/blog/http2" >}}) to understand more about these HTTP2 features.
- Contract-First API Development: Uses Protocol Buffers to define service contracts, ensuring a clear, platform-independent, and language-neutral definition of service interfaces and data structures.
- Streaming Support: Offers four types of service methods, including server streaming, client streaming, and bidirectional streaming, facilitating real-time communication and efficient data transfer.
- Language Agnostic: Supports code generation in multiple languages, allowing seamless interoperability between services written in different programming languages.

# Understanding Protocol Buffers

Before diving into building a gRPC service using dotnet, it is essential to understand protocol buffers. Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) are a language-agnostic, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing and deserializing data. They are integral to gRPC for defining service interfaces and payload messages. They are a method of serializing structured data, similar to XML or JSON, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, and then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.

Protobuf definitions are written in .proto files. It allows you to define simple data structures (messages) and services in a clear, human-readable format. The .proto files can be compiled into source code for various programming languages. This makes Protobuf an excellent choice for backend/frontend data exchange and for systems where multiple languages are used. Protobuf data is serialized into a binary format, which results in significantly smaller and faster messages compared to XML or JSON, reducing network overhead and improving performance. Protobuf is designed to handle schema evolution. You can add new fields to your message formats without breaking backward compatibility. Older code will ignore new fields, and new code can handle missing optional fields.

Protocol Buffers provide several advantages:

- Strongly-Typed Interfaces: Ensures type safety in communication between client and server.
- Code Generation: Automatic generation of client and server code in multiple languages from a single .proto file.
- Efficiency: Binary serialization results in lower network usage and faster data transfer.
- Simple Service Definition: Defining a service in a .proto file is straightforward, and gRPC handles the rest.

## Defining messages and services

Let us build a simple .proto file defining a Customer message along with a CustomerService service. The Customer message includes some basic fields, and the CustomerService service includes RPC methods for retrieving a customer by ID and creating a new customer. The code for the proto file is below

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package customer;

// The customer message definition.
message Customer {
  int32 id = 1;                  // Unique identifier for the customer
  string first_name = 2;         // First name of the customer
  string last_name = 3;          // Last name of the customer
  string email = 4;              // Email address of the customer
}

// The customer service definition.
service CustomerService {
  // Retrieves a customer by their ID.
  rpc GetCustomerById(GetCustomerByIdRequest) returns (GetCustomerResponse);

  // Creates a new customer.
  rpc CreateCustomer(CreateCustomerRequest) returns (CreateCustomerResponse);
}

// Request message for GetCustomerById.
message GetCustomerByIdRequest {
  int32 customer_id = 1;         // ID of the customer to retrieve
}

// Response message for GetCustomerById.
message GetCustomerByIdResponse {
  Customer customer = 1;         // The customer details
}

// Request message for CreateCustomer.
message CreateCustomerRequest {
  Customer customer = 1;         // The customer details to create
}

// Response message for CreateCustomer.
message CreateCustomerResponse {
  Customer customer = 1;         // The newly created customer details
  bool success = 2;              // Whether the creation was successful
  string message = 3;            // Additional message, e.g., error message
}
```

# Building Your First gRPC Service in .NET

Creating a gRPC service involves defining your service and message types in a .proto file, generating the server and client-side code, and then implementing the service logic. Here's how you can build your first gRPC service in .NET:

## Writing Your First Proto file
1. Define the Service and Messages:

- Navigate to the Protos directory in your project.
- Create a new file named greet.proto.
- Define your service and the request and response message types. For example:

```proto

syntax = "proto3";

option csharp_namespace = "GrpcService";

package greet;

// The greeting service definition.
service Greeter {
  // Sends a greeting
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);
}

// The request message containing the user's name.
message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

// The response message containing the greetings.
message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```

- syntax = "proto3";: Specifies that you are using proto3 syntax.
- package greet;: Specifies a package name to prevent name clashes between different projects.
- service Greeter: Defines a service with a method named SayHello.
- Generating C# Code from Proto files

## Configure the Protobuf Tooling:

- Edit the .csproj file in your project and ensure it contains a reference to the Grpc.AspNetCore package and a <Protobuf> item group like this:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <Protobuf Include="Protos\greet.proto" GrpcServices="Server" />
</ItemGroup>
```

This configuration tells the .NET build system to generate the C# classes for your service and messages.

## Build the Project

Run dotnet build. The build process automatically generates the C# classes for the service and messages defined in your .proto files.

## Implementing the Server Side

1. Create a Service Class:
- Navigate to the Services directory.
- Create a new C# class file named GreeterService.cs.
- Implement the service class by inheriting from the generated base class and overriding the method(s):

```csharp
public class GreeterService : Greeter.GreeterBase
{
    public override Task<HelloReply> SayHello(HelloRequest request, ServerCallContext context)
    {
        var reply = new HelloReply
        {
            Message = "Hello " + request.Name
        };
        return Task.FromResult(reply);
    }
}
``````
## Implementing the Client Side

1. Create a Client
- In a real-world scenario, the client would be a separate project or application. For demonstration purposes, you can create a client within the same project or a different one.
- Add the necessary NuGet packages (Grpc.Net.Client, Google.Protobuf, Grpc.Tools) to your client project.
- Use the generated client class to call the service:

```csharp
var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://localhost:5001");
var client = new Greeter.GreeterClient(channel);
var reply = await client.SayHelloAsync(new HelloRequest { Name = "World" });
Console.WriteLine("Greeting: " + reply.Message);
```

You've now successfully defined your service and message types, generated the necessary code, implemented the server side of your gRPC service, and created a client to consume the service. Running both the server and client will allow you to see gRPC in action as your client sends a greeting request to the server and receives a response.

In the next section, we'll discuss best practices in gRPC development to ensure your services are efficient, maintainable, and secure.
