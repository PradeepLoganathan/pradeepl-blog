SQl Server Big Data Clusters were introduced in SQL Server 2019 (Version 15.x). They are a great way to scale your data processing workloads by deploying them on a kubernetes cluster. In the previous post we have seen how to deploy SQL Server 2019 on a kubernetes cluster and create an Always on Availability group. In this post we will deploy SQL Server Big Data Clusters on a kubernetes cluster.

## Logical Architecture

A Big data cluster is composed of four logical layers. The control plane provides the management and security components for the cluster. The compute pool provides computational resources for the cluster. The storage pool provides storage resources for the cluster. The data pool provides data persistence for the cluster.

### Control Plane

### Compute Pool

### Data Pool
