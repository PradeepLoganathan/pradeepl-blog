## MCP Technical Specifications 

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a stateful, JSON-RPC 2.0–based protocol that defines how AI systems interact with external tools, resources, and prompts. While the specification is still evolving, especially in areas such as new capabilities and version negotiation, many technical details are now well understood based on the published spec versions and existing server implementations.

### Protocol Mechanics: Message Structures

MCP communication is built around three primary message types, facilitating the interaction between clients and servers:

- **Requests**: Sent by the client to initiate actions (e.g., execute a tool, read a resource, list available prompts). Each request includes:
  - a unique `id` (integer or string) for correlation,
  - a `method` string (e.g., `"tools/call"`),
  - and a `params` object containing arguments.

- **Responses**: Returned by the server to the client, matching the `id` of a previous request. A response contains either:
  - a `result` object (for success), or
  - an `error` object (containing `code`, `message`, and optionally `data`).

- **Notifications**: Sent asynchronously by the server to inform the client of state changes (e.g., tool list updates, resource changes). These are like requests but omit the `id` field, meaning they don’t expect a reply.

All MCP messages strictly conform to the **JSON-RPC 2.0** specification, using UTF-8 encoded JSON objects. This design promotes ease of parsing and human readability, at the cost of some serialization overhead compared to binary protocols.


### Transport and Communication

Given the likely use of JSON-RPC and the need for persistent, stateful connections, the transport layer for MCP commonly involves protocols capable of supporting this model

- **Standard I/O (STDIO)**: Used for local MCP servers run as subprocesses. JSON-RPC messages are exchanged over stdin/stdout. This is efficient and ideal for toolchains or CLI-style environments.

- **HTTP + Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Used for remote servers. The client establishes a one-way SSE stream (`GET` with `Accept: text/event-stream`) to receive notifications, and sends JSON-RPC requests via `POST` to a session-specific endpoint provided by the server. This combination allows for effective two-way communication without requiring WebSockets.

### State Management and Synchronization

MCP's operation as a stateful protocol is a defining characteristic.18 Unlike stateless protocols where each request is independent, MCP clients and servers maintain context across interactions within potentially long-lived sessions. This statefulness is essential for managing capabilities like tool availability, resource subscriptions, and ongoing conversations or tasks.

The protocol likely employs several mechanisms for state synchronization, inferred from its structure and common patterns in similar protocols:
Watches/Subscriptions: Clients likely need a way to express interest in certain types of information or specific resources/tools managed by the server. This implies a subscription or "watch" mechanism where the client registers its interest, and the server subsequently notifies the client of relevant changes.
Notifications: As previously mentioned, asynchronous notifications are the explicit mechanism for servers to push state updates to interested clients.1 This avoids the need for clients to constantly poll the server for changes.
Acknowledgments (ACK/NACK): While not explicitly detailed for Anthropic's MCP in the provided sources, reliable state synchronization in distributed systems typically requires acknowledgment mechanisms. Similar to how xDS uses version_info and nonce fields to track the configuration state applied by the client and acknowledge updates, MCP likely incorporates (or would need in robust implementations) a way for clients to confirm receipt and successful application of server-sent updates (ACK) or signal rejection due to errors or inconsistencies (NACK). This ensures both client and server have a consistent view of the state.
The stateful nature of MCP, while powerful for enabling dynamic AI interactions, introduces complexities, particularly concerning network infrastructure. Standard load balancers and reverse proxies are often optimized for stateless request-response traffic and may struggle to correctly handle long-lived, stateful MCP sessions, potentially breaking context or distributing related messages incorrectly.18 This architectural mismatch necessitates careful consideration of the network topology and potentially the use of specialized "AI Gateways" designed to understand and manage MCP's stateful communication patterns, as discussed later.
