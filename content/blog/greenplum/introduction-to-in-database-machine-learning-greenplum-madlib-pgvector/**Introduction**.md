**Introduction**

* **The Business Challenge:**
  * Traditional loan approval processes are slow, error-prone, and rely on outdated data.
  * Manual reviews and data silos create bottlenecks and hinder decision-making.
  * Businesses need a way to quickly analyze vast amounts of loan data and make accurate predictions in real-time.
* **The In-Database ML Solution:**
  * In-database machine learning (ML) with Greenplum leverages the power of your existing data warehouse to build and deploy ML models.
  * This eliminates the need to move data out of the database, resulting in faster model training and scoring.
  * Greenplum's MPP architecture enables parallel processing, accelerating ML tasks and providing real-time insights.
