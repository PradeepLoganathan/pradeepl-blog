# Policy as Code: Transforming Governance in the Cloud Era

---

## Introduction to Policy as Code

- Definition: Automating policy creation and enforcement.
- Importance in cloud-native and DevOps practices.

---

## What is Policy as Code (PaC)?

![bg right 70% What is PaC](./images/what-is-pac.jpg)

* Machine-readable definitions of policies and rules
* Used to automate compliance checks and security enforcement
* Written in human-readable formats (YAML, JSON, Rego, etc.)

---

## Why Policy as Code?

* **Speed:** Speed and scalability of cloud computing.
* **Collaboration:** Devs and security teams use the same language/source of truth 
*  **Consistency:** Reducing human errors and inconsistencies.

## Core Concepts and Terminology

- **Policy**: Rules that govern resource use.
- **Code**: Policies defined in code files.
- **Idempotence**: Ensuring repeated executions produce the same result.
- **Immutability**: Unchanging over time.

---

## Tools and Technologies

- **Open Policy Agent (OPA):** General-purpose policy engine
- **HashiCorp Sentinel:** Policy language integrated with Terraform
- **Other Options:**  Checkov, InSpec, etc. 

---

## Workflow & Implementation

- **Policy Creation:** Collaborative process
- **Version Control:**  Git for tracking and changes
- **CI/CD Integration:**  Automate checks in pipelines

---

## Demo: Writing and Testing Policies

- Examples of policy code (e.g., deny public S3 buckets).
- Testing tools and frameworks.

    ```rego
    package example

    default allow = false

    allow {
        input.user == "alice"
    }
    ```

---

## Implementing Policy as Code
